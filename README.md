# The study of the post-mitotic retinal cells using single-cell transcriptional data from paper «Single-cell transcriptional logic of cell-fate specification and guidance in early-born retinal neurons» by Lo Giudice et al. 

## BIO-463 Genomics and bioinformatics, EPFL


In this project, we were specifically concentrated on a subset of the data ; on differentiation trajectories of the retinal progenitor cells. Therefore, we reproduced figure 3G and a part of the figure 3H of the original paper (project_GB.R) using dplyr, patchwork, harmony R libraries. Then, we performed additional analyses that were not in the paper to explain some of the divergences obtained between the original figures and the reproduced ones using scVelo and Scanpy python libraries (project_GB.ipynb). More information is given in the report (report.pdf)
